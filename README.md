# GADS-2021-Community-Project
Covid Fact Checking Site Hosted on GCP
This a site that fact checks misinformation and disinformation about the Coronavirus hosted on Google Cloud that was hosted in Cloud Storage and made public to view by IAM and editor role owned only by owner.
I set up a GCP project in Cloud Console.
Set up a billing account
The final result will be integrated with a domain as Google domain not availble in my country which made it quite easy.
